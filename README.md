I am not a lawyer, doctor, engineer or journalist. I consider myself as a student and activist who is studying bad practice, corruption, and other topics that harm the society. 
I want to bring to your notice misery that such projects have caused to the societies within USA. This documents should not be used as political tools but I will be happy to 
let it be used in Acedmia to showcase how few bad actors hollow the whole society.
