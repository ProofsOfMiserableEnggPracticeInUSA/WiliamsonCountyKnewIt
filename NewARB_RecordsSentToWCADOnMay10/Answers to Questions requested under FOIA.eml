Hi,

BCCP documents talk of "permits" to create and develop a structure that is
more than 3000 sqft (Major structure is coined in BCCP documents as 3000
sq. ft)  near or inside BCCP land. These are covered under - US Fish and
Wildlife services (USFWS ) 10(a)1(b)

Q(1)
If a Builder, a city, or person has land next** to BCCP, do they *need*
permission to construct Major construction such as DAM, ROAD, Ecommerce
Warehouses, etc?
Note**: The land, in this case, does not belong to BCCP but is directly
attached to BCCP land i.e. distance between them is 0 ft. away from BCCP.

Q(2)
If the participation contract is *NOT* signed and a BCCP permit (sometimes
referred to as BCCP Participation Certificate) is *NOT* issued, then what
is the legal action that BCCP Oaths to take? Is there a section of the law
that can be referred or can I be connected with a legal attorney
overlooking BCCP legal in this regard?

Q(3)
Whom(Person, Email) shall I get in touch with for legal questions related
to the rights of BCCP land?

Best Regards,
Sandeep Kalra
