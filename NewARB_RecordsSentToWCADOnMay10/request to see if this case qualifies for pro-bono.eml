Dear Sir/Madam:

I am a resident of Cedar Park tx for many years.  I am originally from
India and I am reaching out for help file what in India they call "PIL"
(public interest litigation). I am unaware of the USA's equivalent of it.

Brief History:
 I have been struggling with my personal case that arises out of the
Anderson Mill Road expansion project (public project) that the city
undertook in 2017-18 and since then I have been going in circles asking for
help and corrections.

For the last 3.5 yrs I have been putting in personal efforts into dealing
with the city, engineering, and many more departments to fix
the wrongdoings.

In the personal effort I took, I found some issues in the system
that I believe are very serious and they are not pertaining to 1 person, 1
project, or just me.

For the last 25+ yrs (at least 25 yrs before 2019) the engineers of the
city of cedar park (and many more cities of texas) are undertaken public
projects and are totally ignoring the "safety" part of it. The "safety" is
mandatory and the legal requirements in my understanding are coming from
TBPE where a licensed PE Engineer must finish "calculations or estimations"
to fulfill engineering drawing and execution. I discovered it in 2019, and
have promptly questioned TBPE, DOT, and FHWA. They all do not have
"oversight" over what the city does.

To highlight the depth of the issue:
Every year 10,000 traffic deaths happen in texas. Assuming just 2% of them
are responsible for bad design and bad engineering. Then the number of
Americans that lost life is 200 per year. Now scaling it to just 20 yrs
(than 25 yrs), the number is 4000 American lives lost. The 20 yrs is what
USA spent in Afghanistan. They lost less than 4000 people there.

I will provide with all the work I have put in last 3.5 yrs and will like
to see if this qualifies in your eyes as a candidate for pro-bono.

Sandeep Kalra
