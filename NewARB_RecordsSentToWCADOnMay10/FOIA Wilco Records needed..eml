I have raised appraisal protest on my property (201 Gaspar Bend, Cedar Park
TX). I will need some information from you.

In the 2018 appraisal meeting at the Georgetown office, I submitted to the
ARB that the city of cedar park, and many more cities in Wilco are not
creating infrastructure as per guidelines provided by the safety ordinance
they or texas govt. has laid down. *I will need an email copy of those
documents. Please provide them to me.*

I have also raised my voice in city meetings, and have given them on
multiple occasions written letters showing how they have misused their
power and funds that Wilco has accumulated and provided them for the
betterment. I have raised the same to the Texas board of
engineering(TBPE).  Knowing this, why has Wilco not taken any action?* If
wilco have taken any concrete action, then please provide proof so that I
can withdraw my application to market protest or else I will go on to meet
the ARB and then the head of Wilco. *

If wilco cannot provide in writing why public money from me and thousands
of us are misused to make unsafe and at times below quality infrastructure,
then I am obliged to raise this and ask them to not collect the money and
instead raise this with Texas govt, that may have otherwise higher
standards that they follow. CC: roads@wilco.org if they know anything?


I will need answers.


What rights do Wilco have to misuse the money this way? I know you may not
have answers. If you cannot, then please redirect the email to the right
person or send me the email of a person or Wilco committee that may have
the answers.
