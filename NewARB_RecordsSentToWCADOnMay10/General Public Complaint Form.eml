Hi, Texas Cities employ Licensed Engineers to work on public projects. They=
 have from last 25 yrs not performed safety calculation whenever and wherev=
er possible. They outsource design to 3rd party that charges astronomical t=
o do calculations, and in turn cities
 stopped asking them either and without need, the 3rd party also stopped wo=
rking on them. So, in theory - all public projects done are unsafe by desig=
n. Given 3500 texans die due to road accidents, and if you just consider ba=
d-design as only 10% responsible
 (although i think it must be 30+%), over 25 yrs we are talking of 7000+ de=
aths due to single cause -- more than what US fatalities were in 20 yrs of =
war in Afganistan! Surprisingly, TBPE(Tx board of PE) cannot act on city en=
gineers, so these &quot;killings&quot; as
 I may call are okay to many. When I caught city engineers wrong doing, I w=
as discouraged by other engineers, HOA, CDOT, other staff and to some exten=
d TBPE also tried pushing back on it till I started writing about it to hig=
her up (for one - i did wrote to
 the office of president of USA too). My complaints are sitting with TBPE s=
ince 2017. Who need external terrorist orgs, when your own can perform job =
efficiently and get paid officially for doing it. What I hope from this com=
plaint is 2 fold: 1. Justice to
 my case, that I have been waiting for 5 yrs now, 2. Justice to others and =
fixing the system so that no one suffer due to bad governance. PS[1] Proof =
of claims will be provided on request. Have them in writing from my local c=
ity&#39;s licensed engineer. PS[2] I
 prefer to coordinate in writing via email. I am 20 minutes away from Austi=
n, and can come down to meet in 1:1 or in official setting if there is a ne=
ed. I am however not good with phone-calls.
